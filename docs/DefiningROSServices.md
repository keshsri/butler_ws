## Implementing and Testing ROS Services for the State Machine

### 1. Defined ROS Services

Defined several ROS services to allow for more controlled interactions with the state machine. These services enable synchronous requests and responses, ensuring that the robot's actions are coordinated with other parts of the system:

- **/request_order**: Initiates a new order, transitioning the state machine from `HOME` to `TO_KITCHEN`.
- **/confirm_kitchen**: Confirms that the robot has picked up the food from the kitchen, moving the state machine to `TO_TABLE`.
- **/confirm_delivery**: Confirms that the delivery has been made to the customer, transitioning the state machine to `RETURN_HOME`.
- **/abort_mission**: Stops the current task and returns the robot to the `HOME` position.

### 2. Implemented Service Servers

- Updated the state machine to include service servers for each of the defined services. These servers handle requests and transition the state machine to the appropriate state based on the service called.

### 3. Testing the Services

Tested each of the services by manually calling them using the `ros2 service call` command. The state machine successfully transitioned between states based on the services invoked:

- **/request_order**: Successfully started a new order and transitioned the state machine to `TO_KITCHEN`.
- **/confirm_kitchen**: Confirmed the kitchen pickup and moved the state machine to `TO_TABLE`.
- **/confirm_delivery**: Completed the delivery and returned the robot to `HOME`.
- **/abort_mission**: Aborted the current task and reset the state machine to `HOME`.

### 4. Integration with Existing Topics

The services were tested alongside the previously implemented topics to ensure seamless interaction between asynchronous events and controlled actions. The state machine is now capable of responding to both topics and service calls.

### 5. Next Steps

- **Further Integration and Testing**: We can proceed to integrate these services with other nodes or components in the robot's system, such as navigation or task management.
- **Final Testing in a Simulated Environment**: To validate the full behavior of the state machine in a simulated or real-world environment.

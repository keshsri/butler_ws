## Defining and Testing ROS Topics for the State Machine

### 1. Defined ROS Topics

Defined several ROS topics to enable the state machine to interact with other components of the robot system. These topics allow the state machine to transition between states based on external events:

- **/order_received**: Triggers the state machine when a new order is received. The state machine transitions from `HOME` to `TO_KITCHEN`.
- **/kitchen_arrival**: Indicates when the robot has arrived at the kitchen, transitioning the state machine to `AT_KITCHEN`.
- **/food_ready**: Signals that the food is ready for pickup, moving the state machine from `AT_KITCHEN` to `TO_TABLE`.
- **/table_arrival**: Notifies when the robot has arrived at a specific table, transitioning to `AT_TABLE`.
- **/delivery_confirmed**: Confirms that the delivery has been made to the customer, moving the state machine from `AT_TABLE` to `RETURN_HOME`.
- **/cancel_order**: Cancels the current order, returning the robot to `HOME`.

### 2. Implemented Topic Subscriptions and Publishers

- Updated the state machine code to include subscribers for each of the above topics. This allows the state machine to listen for messages and react accordingly.
- A publisher for the current state was also added to broadcast the robot's current state.

### 3. Testing the Topics

Tested each of the defined topics by manually publishing messages to them using the `ros2 topic pub` command. The state machine successfully transitioned through its states based on the messages received:

- **/order_received**: Triggered the transition from `HOME` to `TO_KITCHEN`.
- **/kitchen_arrival**: Successfully moved the state machine to `AT_KITCHEN`.
- **/food_ready**: Transitioned the state machine from `AT_KITCHEN` to `TO_TABLE`.
- **/table_arrival**: Confirmed the robot's arrival at the table, moving to `AT_TABLE`.
- **/delivery_confirmed**: Completed the delivery and returned the robot to `HOME`.
- **/cancel_order**: Canceled the order and reset the state machine to `HOME`.

### 4. Next Steps

- **Integration with Other Components**: The next step is to integrate these topics with other components of the robot system, such as navigation or sensor data.
- **Implementing ROS Services**: Plan to define and implement ROS services to allow for more controlled interactions with the state machine.
